# Pushing to multiple remotes with one command

There's a question on StackOverflow - [Able to push to all git remotes with the one command?][ques].

The solution I fell in love with is to create remote named "all" and place multiple urls there:

    [remote "all"]
    url = origin-host:path/proj.git
    url = nodester-host:path/proj.git
    url = duostack-host:path/proj.git

It works, now I'm able to push my project to all Gitlab, Github and Bitbucket with just one command - "git push all master", for example.
